# Magic Squares Mobile

## Project Introduction

This project is a continuation of [Magic Squares](https://github.com/russellf9/magic-squares) focusing on creating the Magic Squares game for iOS using Ionic.

### Description

A logic puzzle where the objective is to solve a 3Ã—3 magic square.

### Project Aims

The primary objective is to release an iOS app on iTunes.

### Further objectives.

I've just submitted the app to Apple for verification. I'll list my new objectives here:

1. Incorporate Gulp more. ( For the ionic build etc )

2. Document the iOS submission process.

3. Use SASS. ( The CSS has become far too verbose for all the screen sixes etc. )

4. Make more use of [Flexbox](http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/samplechapter/cheatsheet.html).

5. Improve the design.

6. Add different sets of numbers.

7. Add levels.

8. Add scores.

9. Add a timer.


## Original Cordova Installation

(Update to Xcode 6 first!)

```
$ sudo npm install -g cordova ionic

$ ionic start magic-squares blank

```

### Develop in the browser with live reload:

```

- issue with cmd. Will re-visit with Gulp.
